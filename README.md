# Pong-Game
This game is a basic pong game designed using VHDL. The game displays on a VGA monitor through a DE2-115 board. The game consists of a ball moving around on the screen. The boundaries for the ball are set as the top and bottom of the screen as well as a vertical bar on the left side of the screen. The ball is programmed to bounce off any of these boundaries as well as the paddle. The paddle moves vertically along the right side of the screen attempting to catch the ball before it reaches the right wall. The paddle is controlled using push buttons on the DE2-115 board. The far left push button (Key 3) moves the paddle up and the push button second from the left (Key 2) moves the paddle down. If the paddle reaches the top or bottom wall, it will stop moving, even if the push button is still being pressed.
